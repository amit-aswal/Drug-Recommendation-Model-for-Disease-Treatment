# Drug-Recommendation-Model-for-Disease-Treatment
Developed a predictive model to recommend the most appropriate drug (Drug A, Drug B, Drug C, Drug X, or Drug Y) for patients suffering from a specific disease based on their medical characteristics.
- Abstract
Data has been collected on a group of patients, who suffered from the same disease. During their course of treatment, each patient responded to one of 5 drugs, Drug A, Drug B, Drug C, Drug X, and Drug Y. It is then possible to build a model to find out which drug might be appropriate for a future patient with the same disease. The characteristics of this data set are age, sex, blood pressure, cholesterol of the patients, Sodium to potassium ratio in blood of the patient and the target is the drug to which each of these patients responded.

It is a sample of a multiclass classifier, and you can use the training part of the dataset to build a decision tree and then use it to predict the class of an unknown patient or to prescribe a drug to a new patient.

There are 6 variables in this data set:

4 categorical variables and 2 continuous variables.

The feature sets are:

Age -> Patient Age
Sex -> Gender of patient (male or female)
BP -> Blood Pressure Levels of patient (high, normal, or low)
Cholesterol -> Cholesterol Levels of patient (high or normal)
Na_to_K -> Sodium to potassium ratio in blood of patient
Drug -> Type of drug
Objective
For the development of the notebook, we will use a predictive technique through supervised learning for data analysis. This classification algorithm will be carried out through the decision tree technique.

Develop a classification model using Decision Tree Algorithm.

Develop an ensemble method using the Random Forest model.

Dataset exploration using various types of data visualization.
